    <h2 id="section1">1. Early Life and Education</h2>
    <p>
        Kibaki was born on 15 November 1931 in Gatuyaini village, Othaya division of Kenya's then Nyeri District (now Nyeri County).[5] 
        He was the youngest son of Kikuyu peasants Kibaki Gĩthĩnji and Teresia Wanjikũ. 
        Though baptised as Emilio Stanley by Italian missionaries in his youth, he has been known as Mwai Kibaki throughout his public life.[6] 
        Kibaki started his schooling at the village school in Gatuyaini, where he completed two years.[5] 
        He then continued his education at the Karima mission school, close to Othaya town, before moving to Mathari School (now Nyeri High School) between 1944 and 1946.[7] 
        In addition to his academic studies, he learned carpentry and masonry at the school. 
        After Karima Primary and Nyeri Boarding primary schools, he proceeded to Mang'u High School, 
        where he studied between 1947 and 1950, gaining the highest grade in his O Level examinations.[5]
        <br><br>
        In his last year at Mang'u, Kibaki briefly considered enlisting in the army, but this ambition was thwarted when Kenya's Chief colonial secretary, Walter Coutts, prohibited members of Kikuyu, Embu, and Meru communities from joining the military. Kibaki instead attended Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, where he studied economics, history, and political science. He graduated with a first class honours degree in economics.[5] 
        After graduation, Kibaki remained in Uganda, working for the Shell Company of East Africa. 
        He then earned a scholarship entitling him to undertake postgraduate studies at any British university. 
        He chose the London School of Economics, from which he obtained a BSc in public finance, with distinction.[8] 
        In 1958, he went back to Makerere, where he taught as an assistant lecturer in the economics department until 1961.[5] 
        In 1961, Kibaki married Lucy Muthoni, the daughter of a church minister, who was then a secondary school head teacher.[5]

    <h2 id="section2">2. Political Career Prior to Presidency</h2>
    <h3>1960–2002</h3>
    <p>
        In early 1960, Mwai Kibaki left academia for active politics by giving up his job at Makerere and returning to Kenya to become an executive officer of Kenya African National Union (KANU), 
        at the request of Thomas Joseph Mboya[9] (who was the secretary general of KANU). 
        Kibaki then helped to draft Kenya's independence constitution.[10]
        <br><br>
        In 1963, Kibaki was elected as Member of Parliament for the Doonholm Constituency (subsequently called Bahati and now known as Makadara) in Nairobi.[11] 
        His election was the start of a long political career. 
        In 1963 Kibaki was appointed the Permanent Secretary for the Treasury.[12] 
        Appointed Assistant Minister of Finance and chairman of the Economic Planning Commission in 1963, 
        he was promoted to Minister of Commerce and Industry in 1966.[13] In 1969, he became Minister of Finance and Economic Planning where he served until 1982.[14]
        <br><br>
        In 1974, Kibaki, facing serious competition for his Doonholm Constituency seat from an opponent Mrs. Jael Mbogo, 
        whom he had only narrowly and controversially beaten for the seat in the 1969 elections,[15] moved his political base from Nairobi to his rural home, 
        Othaya, where he was subsequently elected as Member of Parliament. 
        The same year Time magazine rated him among the top 100 people in the world who had the potential to lead. 
        He was re-elected Member of Parliament for Othaya in the subsequent elections of 1979, 1983, 1988, 1992, 1997, 2002, and 2007.[16]
        <br><br>
        When Daniel arap Moi succeeded Jomo Kenyatta as President of Kenya in 1978, 
        Kibaki was elevated to the Vice Presidency, 
        and kept the Finance portfolio until Moi changed his ministerial portfolio from Finance to Home Affairs in 1982. 
        He had in 1978 rejected an offer to become World Bank Vice President for Africa instead choosing to further his political career. 
        As of 2023, he is still regarded as one of the most effective and consequentual finance ministers of the Republic of Kenya. 
        Later as President, he kept close tabs with the treasury and directly influenced key economic policies resulting in steady economic growth. 
        Kibaki fell out of favour with President Moi in March 1988, and was dropped as vice president and moved to the Ministry of Health.[16][17]
        <br><br>
        Kibaki's political style during these years was described as gentlemanly and non-confrontational. 
        This style exposed him to criticism that he was a spineless, or even cowardly, 
        politician who never took a stand: according to one joke, "He never saw a fence he didn't sit on".[18] Similarly, 
        Kenneth Matiba also referred to him as "General Kiguoya" for refusing to 
        resign the Kanu government and join the opposition after he was dropped as vice president in 1988. 
        'Kiguoya' translates to the 'fearful one' in the Kikuyu language. He also, as the political circumstances of the time dictated, 
        projected himself as a loyal stalwart of the ruling single party, KANU. In the months before multi-party politics were introduced in 1992, 
        he infamously declared that agitating for multi-party democracy and trying to dislodge KANU from power was like "trying to cut down a fig tree with a razor blade".[18]
        <br><br>
        It was therefore with great surprise that the country received the news of Kibaki's resignation from government and leaving KANU on Christmas Day in December 1991, 
        only days after the repeal of Section 2A of the then Constitution of Kenya, 
        which restored the multi-party system of government. 
        Soon after his resignation, Kibaki founded the Democratic Party (DP)[19] and entered the presidential race in the upcoming multi-party elections of 1992. 
        Kibaki was regarded as one of the favourites among Moi's challengers, 
        although his support came mainly from the Kikuyu voters as the election was fought along ethnic lines, 
        confirming a prediction made by both Moi and political analysts at the beginning of multipartyism.[20]
        <br><br>
        Kibaki came third in the subsequent presidential elections of 1992, 
        when the divided opposition lost to president Moi and KANU despite having received more than two-thirds of the vote.[21][22] 
        He then came second to Moi in the 1997 elections, when again, Moi beat a divided opposition to retain the presidency.[23] 
        Kibaki joined third-placed Raila Odinga in accusing the president of rigging the poll, 
        and both opposition leaders boycotted Moi's swearing in for his fifth term in office.[24]
    </p>

    <h3>2002 Elections</h3>
    <p>
        In preparation for the 2002 elections, Kibaki's Democratic Party affiliated with several other opposition parties to form the National Alliance of Rainbow Coalition (NARC). 
        A group of disappointed KANU presidential aspirants then quit KANU in protest after being overlooked by outgoing President Moi when Moi had Uhuru Kenyatta 
        (founding Father Jomo Kenyatta's son and Kibaki's successor as Kenya's 4th President after the 2013 General Election) nominated to be the KANU presidential candidate, 
        and hurriedly formed the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). NAK later combined with the LDP to form the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC). 
        On 14 October 2002, at a large opposition rally in Uhuru Park, Nairobi, Kibaki was nominated the NARC opposition alliance presidential candidate after Raila Odinga made the famous declaration; 
        "Kibaki Tosha!" (Swahili for "Kibaki [is] enough")[25]
        <br><br>
        On 3 December 2002, Kibaki was injured in a road accident while on his way back to Nairobi from a campaign meeting at Machakos junction 40 kilometres (25 miles) from Nairobi. 
        He was subsequently hospitalized in Nairobi, then London, after sustaining fracture injuries in the accident.[26] 
        After the accident, he had to move using a wheel chair up to months later after his presidency. 
        For the remainder of his life, he walked rather awkwardly as a result of those injuries.
        <br><br>
        The rest of his presidential campaign was thus conducted by his NARC colleagues in his absence, 
        led by Raila Odinga and Kijana Wamalwa (who went on to become the Vice President) who campaigned tirelessly for Kibaki after stating, 
        "The captain has been injured in the field... but the rest of the team shall continue."[26] 
        On 27 December 2002, Kibaki and NARC won a landslide victory over KANU, 
        with Kibaki getting 62% of the votes in the presidential elections, against only 31% for the KANU candidate Uhuru Kenyatta.[27]
    </p>

    <h2 id="section3">3. Presidency</h2>
    <h3>Swearing in</h3>
    <p>
        On 30 December 2002, still nursing injuries from the motor vehicle accident and in a wheel chair, 
        Kibaki was sworn in as the third President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kenya, 
        in front of thousands of cheering supporters at the historic Uhuru Park within Nairobi City. 
        At his inauguration, he stressed his opposition to government corruption, saying:
        <br><br>
        "Government will no longer be run on the whims of individuals."[28]
        <br><br>
        Kibaki's swearing in marked the end of four decades of KANU rule, the party having ruled Kenya since independence.[29] 
        Moi, who had been in power for 24 years, began his retirement.[30]
    </p>

    <h3>Leadership style</h3>
    <p>
        President Kibaki's style was that of a low key publicity averse but highly intelligent and competent technocrat.[31]
        <br><br>
        He, unlike his predecessors, never tried to establish a personality cult;[32] 
        never had his portrait on every unit of Kenya's currency; never had all manner of streets, 
        places, and institutions named after him;[32] never had state sanctioned praise songs composed in his honour; 
        never dominated news bulletins with reports of his presidential activities - however routine or mundane; 
        and never engaged in the populist sloganeering of his predecessors.[31]
        <br><br>
        His style of leadership gave him the image of a seemingly aloof, 
        withdrawn technocrat or intellectual and made him seem out of touch with the street,[33] 
        and his seemingly hands-off leadership-by-delegation style made his governments, 
        especially at the cabinet level, appear dysfunctional.[34]
    </p>

    <h2 id="section4">4. Personal Life</h2>
    <p>
        Kibaki was married to Lucy Muthoni from 1961 until her death in 2016.[116] 
        They had four children: Judy Wanjiku, Jimmy Kibaki, David Kagai, and Tony Githinji. 
        They also had several grandchildren: Joy Jamie Marie, Rachael Muthoni, Mwai Junior, and Krystinaa Muthoni.[117] 
        Jimmy Kibaki has declared and aspired to be his father's political heir, 
        though he has been unsuccessful in that endeavor so far.[118]
        <br><br>
        In 2004, the media reported that Kibaki had a second spouse, whom he allegedly married under customary law, Mary Wambui, and a daughter, Wangui Mwai. 
        State House in response released an unsigned statement that Kibaki's only immediate family at the time was his then wife, Lucy, and their four children.[119] 
        In 2009, Kibaki, with Lucy in close attendance, held an odd press conference to re-state publicly that he only had one wife.[120] 
        The matter of Kibaki's alleged mistress, and his wife's unusually dramatic public reactions therein, 
        provided an embarrassing side-show during his presidency, with the Washington Post[121] terming the entire scandal as a "new Kenyan soap opera".
        <br><br>
        Ms. Wambui, the rather popular "other woman", 
        who enjoyed the state trappings of a presidential spouse and became a powerful and wealthy business-woman during the Kibaki Presidency,[122] 
        frequently drove Lucy into episodes of highly embarrassing very publicly displayed rage.[123] 
        Ms. Wambui, despite opposition from Kibaki's family, 
        led publicly by Kibaki's son, Jimmy, and despite Kibaki's public endorsement and campaign for her opponent, 
        succeeded Kibaki as Member of Parliament for Othaya in the 2013 General Election.[124] 
        In December 2014, Senator Bonny Khalwale stated on KTN's Jeff Koinange Live that President Kibaki had introduced Wambui as his wife.[125]
        <br><br>
        Kibaki enjoyed playing golf and was a member of the Muthaiga Golf Club.[126] 
        He was a practicing and a very committed member of the Roman Catholic Church and attended Consolata Shrines Catholic Church in Nairobi every Sunday at noon.[127]
        <br><br>
        On 21 August 2016, Kibaki was taken to Karen Hospital,[128] and later flew to South Africa for specialized treatment. 
        Unlike the Kenyatta and Moi families, Kibaki's family has shown little interest in politics save for his nephew Nderitu Muriithi, 
        Governor of Laikipia County, from 2017 to 2022.
    </p>

    <h2 id="section5">5. Death</h2>
    <p>
        Kibaki died on 21 April 2022, at the age of 90. His death was announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta, 
        who issued a proclamation that Kibaki would be granted a state funeral with full civilian and military honors 
        and declared a period of national mourning with flags flying at half-mast until President Mwai Kibaki is buried.[129]
        <br><br>
        On 25 April 2022, his body was taken to Parliament buildings on a military gun carriage to offset the lying in state component of his state funeral. 
        President Uhuru Kenyatta and First Lady wife Margaret Kenyatta led Kenyans in viewing the body. 
        His body was laid on a catafalque at the Speaker's way bearing the colour of his presidential standard and dressed in his trademark pin-striped suits. 
        His body was also guarded by four Kenya Defence Forces colonels changing shifts after two hours. 
        The lying in state continued until 27 April 2022 ahead of funeral service held at Nyayo National Stadium on 29 April 2022 
        which was attended by key dignitaries including some sitting presidents. 
        He was finally interred at his Othaya home in Nyeri County on 30 April 2022 with full military honors after a church service held by the Catholic church[130] 
        at Othaya approved school. 
        The honors included the Last Post and The Long Reveille bugle cry, a 19 gun salute and The Missing Man formation fly past.[131][132] 
        South Sudan declared three days of mourning;[133] Tanzania declared two days of mourning.[134][135]
